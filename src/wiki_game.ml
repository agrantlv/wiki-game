   articles. In particular, we should discard links that are:

   - resources that are external to Wikipedia

   One nice think about Wikipedia is that stringent content moderation results in
   uniformity in article format. We can expect that all Wikipedia article links parsed
   from a Wikipedia page will have the form "/wiki/<TITLE>". *)
